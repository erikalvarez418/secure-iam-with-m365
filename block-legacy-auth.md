# Block Legacy Authentication

## Objective

Block legacy authentication protocols (such as POP, IMAP, SMTP) that do not support modern security controls like MFA. These protocols are often used in password spray and brute force attacks.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Entra Admin Center
- Conditional Access

## Why This Matters

Legacy authentication methods bypass MFA and are frequently targeted by attackers. Blocking these protocols helps reduce the organizationâ€™s attack surface and aligns with Zero Trust principles.

## Steps

### 1. Access Conditional Access
